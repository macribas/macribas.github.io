Not an April's Fool Post
========================
It's been a while I haven't posted, so this might feel like a prank. It isn't. I'm going to try to get back to the habit of writing and sharing my things here. 
For music, life, business, fun, there are other places, like Medium, Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn. Every day I learn something new in tech. This is where I'll be sharing tech tips. 
Welcome back!
